## Design

### Colour Scheme  
I choose a dark color scheme as I felt it fit with the image of the gym and is also very clean and distintive. I decided on a font color of ivory to really set off the text on the darker background. The hero image was them selected in black and white format to follow the scheme, given this dark hero image I wanted text that really caught the eye. I chose hex #f5f5f5 for the text color and first used Charles Darwins icon of the evolution of man, but as this was too clutered I went with a shadowing on the text from https://codepen.io/ryandsouza13/pen/yEBJQV which gave the text depth. The shadow is a combination of hex #919191 and rgba(16,16,16) with different levels of opacity from 0.2 to 0.4. This color scheme was then appied throughout the site.

### Typography
The font for the site is Bree Serif, this was the right choice as it is a friendly italic which brings a comfort and warmth to many straight line on the site. It work well in both upper and lower case adn is clearly legable. The hero image text shows this in large uppercase font witha shaddow effect giving it great prominence.

### Imagery
The imagery was chossen in keeping with teh colour sheme and to be visually descriptive and figurative, while reamining simple and shows a very spacious well equiped gym.

### Future Releases
It is my vision of this site is instil a mindset of of growth and personal development in users visiting the site, the name Evolve was chosen especially to do this. I want to provide a unique 'Access All Areas' of a persons physical improvement process and the variables required to acheive this such as science based workouts, diets, nutrition and the correct supplimentation to make that a reality. Future releases will introduce pages dedicated to diet, weight management, nutrition, supplement recommendations and training schedules with progress trackers. The purpose is to increase 'stickyness' and traffic to the site by providing this updated information. This may also mean promoting the site as an advertising space for a partner fitness supplement vendor to promote weekly/monthly deals which will futher increase stickiness and traffic to the site.


## Features
The site containd navigational links at the top of each page and linke to our Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Insagram platforms.While the home pages provides a clear look at the gym and equipment the 'Join Now!' button is on all pages other than the mebership page which it directs the user to.
