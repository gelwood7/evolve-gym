# Overview

![Only the fittest will survive - Charles Darwin](./assets/images/ReadmeQuote.JPG)

The Evolve gym website was designed with a primary purpose of a business website to showcase the gym and get membership. Its goal is to achieve this by providing a positive user experience where the user has a 'one-stop shop' for everything required to set and achieve their goals, state of the art Evolve gym, enthusiastic staff, science-based workouts, diet, and nutritional advice. Providing this additional information gives the site 'stickiness' so that the user will bookmark and return to the site may times for the content increasing the possibility of signing up!

The website is fully responsive and can be viewed across all devices.

## Design

### Colour Scheme  
I chose a dark colour scheme as I felt it fit with the image of the gym and is also very clean and distinctive. I decided on a font colour of ivory to really set off the text on the darker background. The hero image was then selected in black and white format to follow the scheme, given this dark hero image I wanted text that really caught the eye. I chose hex #f5f5f5 for the text colour and first used Charles Darwin’s icon of the evolution of man, but as this was too cluttered, I went with a shadowing on the text from https://codepen.io/ryandsouza13/pen/yEBJQV which gave the text depth. The shadow is a combination of hex #919191 and rgba(16,16,16) with different levels of opacity from 0.2 to 0.4. This colour scheme was then applied throughout the site.

### Typography
The font for the site is Bree Serif, this was the right choice as it is a friendly italic which brings a comfort and warmth to many straight lines on the site. It works well in both upper and lower case and is clearly legible. The hero image text shows this in large uppercase font with a shadow effect giving it great prominence.

### Imagery
The imagery was chosen in keeping with the colour scheme and to be visually descriptive and figurative, while remaining simple and shows a very spacious well-equipped gym.

### Future Releases
It is my vision of this site is to instill a mindset of growth and personal development in users visiting the site, the name Evolve was chosen specially to do this. I want to provide a unique 'Access All Areas' of a person’s physical improvement process and the variables required to achieve this such as science-based workouts, diets, nutrition, and the correct supplementation to make that a reality. Future releases will introduce pages dedicated to diet, weight management, nutrition, supplement recommendations and training schedules with progress trackers. The purpose is to increase 'stickiness' and traffic to the site by providing this updated information. This may also mean promoting the site as an advertising space for a partner fitness supplement vendor to promote weekly/monthly deals which will further increase stickiness and traffic to the site.


## Features
The site contains navigational links at the top of each page and linked to our Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram platforms. While the home pages provide a clear look at the gym and equipment the 'Join Now!' button is on all pages other than the membership page which it directs the user to. Here the user can fill their details, select the membership they are interested in, and a member of our team will contact them ASAP. This form validates the information prior to being submitted and prompts the users if there is an issue. The times/location page contains a fully functional embedded Google map showing our location. On the workout page we have various embedded YouTube videos which again are fully functional and very educational, I use them myself for training!

## Deployment

### Project Creation  

The project was first created using a template supplied by Code Institute, this was utilised by navigating to the [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking 'Use this template'. I used 'Evolve Gym' as my repository name and checked the 'Include all branches' checkbox. I then navigated to the [Evolve Gym repository](https://github.com/gelwood7/evolve-gym). Opening the 'Code' dropdown, selected 'HTTPS' and copied the link.   

I opened the 'bash terminal' in Visual studio and typed the git clone link from clipboard, open folder, and navigated to the local repository created. Throughout the project I used the following to add, commit and push my code to the repository:  

- git add . - This added all saved changes made across all files in GitPod

- git commit -m "description" - Used to add a description of the latest code update and commit this for addition to the repository. This can later be accessed at any point of the project ypou wish to return to.

- git push - This pushes the committed code to the GitHub repository.

### GitHub Pages

Go to GitHub [Evolve Gym repository](https://github.com/gelwood7/evolve-gym):  

- Click 'Settings' Tab.
- Scroll Down to GitHub Pages Heading.
- Select 'Master Branch' as the source.
- Click Save.
- Click link to navigate to the deployed live site.  

### Run Project locally
